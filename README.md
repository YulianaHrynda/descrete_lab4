# Finite State Machine

This Python program models a finite state machine representing a person's daily routine. The person goes through different states based on the time of day and random events.

## Usage

To run the program, simply execute the `day.py` file:

```bash
python day.py
```

## Description

The finite state machine consists of the following states:

- **Sleep**: Represents the state when the person is sleeping.
- **Morning routine**: Represents the state when the person wakes up and performs their morning routine.
- **Eat**: Represents the state when the person eats breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
- **Relax**: Represents the state when the person relaxes, interacts with friends, or receives a call from their mom.
- **Walk**: Represents the state when the person takes a walk.
- **Study**: Represents the state when the person is studying or preparing for exams.

Random events can occur during the day, such as meeting an old friend, receiving a call from mom, or experiencing rain. These events may affect the person's mental health and hunger levels.
